**Project Description**

Swing trading is a style of trading that attempts to capture short-to medium-term gains in a stock (or any financial instrument) over a period of a few days to several weeks. Swing traders primarily use technical 
analysis to look for trading opportunities. Here we primarily manage user Portfolio and deal with the trading of stocks in real time. 

**Tools and Frameworks Used:**

To store user data, we have used .json files which store user data in the form of key value pairs. The key is mainly the username and values are the different values that we need to store.  
Our user interface is made mainly by using Java Swing Framework. 
We have used AWT which has all the classes to create user interface and for graphics and images. 
We have used stock APIS to fetch real time data about the stocks like their opening price, closing price etc.
